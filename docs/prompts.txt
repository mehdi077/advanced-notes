refer to @docs/langchain.txt to know how to implement the following: using a model from open router (have a special file that selects which model      │
│   to use and tell me how to use it to select a model to be used throught all this project, the idea i want to implement, is kinda like an auto           │
│   complition, so there will be collabsable side bar from the left, where it has a button, lets say i am writing, and want to auto complete 2             │
│   scentances from the last word i wrote, i click the button of the left sidebar, and langchain takes all text i wrote untill the last '.' i did, or      │
│   the last 'new line' i did, and feed it to the llm through the api, with the following prompt "provide a two sentance long complition to this text:     │
│    <the text that i wrote whcich will be pulled from the ducoment as discribed>, respond with only the complition you did", and then the output gets     │
│    automaticly written after the last word i wrote in the document 





Make in the same style and tone a text completion and continuation to the thoughts and ideas in the thread that will be provided below, keep the same writing style, focus only on real facts, speak in the same perspective as the writer uses in the text, and don’t justify what was said, go with it, continue the flow, provide complex ideas using simple words, and if had to use complex words and terms to drive the point home precisly,use it but explain the word in parentheses (important considiration: the completion should one paragraphs max, very abstract, and doesn't have an open ended end)
